# Bootcamp Python

## Introduction
This project is an approach to the python language and the libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## General guidelines
1. It is recommended to follow the PEP 8 standards. You can install pycodestyle which is a tool to check your Python code.
2. The function eval is never allowed.
3. The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
4. Your manual is the internet
